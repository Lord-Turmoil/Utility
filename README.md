# Utility
Some tiny utility python scripts.

## Scanner
### Description
Pack images in given directory into PDF. No extra work is done, just simple and easy.
### TODO
Well, it won't adjust image size. Needs later works to be done.

## Renamer
### Description
Batch rename files in given directory.
### Background
I love movies and series, but the name is really long. I just want `S03E07.mkv` out of `LEGO.NinjaGo.blablabla.S03E07.ATOM.blabla.mkv`, and too tiring to rename manually from S01 to S14.
